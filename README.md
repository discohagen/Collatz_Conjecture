# Collatz Conjecture Plotter

A Python script that visualizes the Collatz conjecture using the Turtle graphics library.
The Collatz conjecture is a fascinating mathematical problem, and this script provides an interactive way to explore its sequences.

## Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a sequence defined as follows:
- Start with any positive integer greater than one.
- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the current number is odd, triple it and add 1.
- Repeat the process.

The conjecture suggests that, regardless of the starting number, the sequence will always eventually reach the cycle [4, 2, 1].

## Visualization
The script uses Turtle graphics to plot the Collatz conjecture.

Feel free to experiment with different starting numbers and observe the fascinating patterns that emerge in the Collatz conjecture!
